# CS334 Final Project
GeoDraw is a language that lets you use basic math equations (lines, circles, parabolas, etc) to construct basic cartoon drawings. This is inspired by a project in high school that was designed to help us learn more about geometry through drawing cartoons using geometrical equations. It was difficult to find a graphing calculator online that made this particular project easy, for example, one where you have control over the colors of your lines. GeoDraw will be a be a fun educational tool to strengthen students knowledge of geometrical equations.

This language can also be viewed as a gentle introduction to computer graphics, which use much more complex mathematical equations, and to programming more generally. For that reason simplicity is an important part of our language design. Finally, this language allows users to bring out their inner artist, by experimenting with our fun brush designs, or customizing their own!

For more information about how to use GeoDraw, check out our Tutorial or Language Specification!
